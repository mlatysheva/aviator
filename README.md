## Installing and Running the app
- the backend is built with JSON-server and is located in the folder `backend`. Our repository `aviator` is built as a mono-repository with two packages - one for the frontend and the other - for the backend.
- `clone` or download the `develop` branch of the app
- `cd` into the folder where you downloaded the app
- run `npm run install:all` - to install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend
- run `npm run start:all` - to start the server and the app at the same time. The app will be running on https://localhost:4200 and the server will be running on https://localhost:3000

### Alternatively, you can start only the server by: 
- `cd` into the `backend` folder and run `npm run start` to start the server on https://localhost:4200 and
- use the deployed app hosted at https://mlatysheva.github.io/aviator/
